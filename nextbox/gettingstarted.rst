Ready To Go

This is all it takes to get started with your NextBox. From this point you are
free to choose how you would like to make the best use of your personal
Nextcloud-powered cloud. To get you started, here is a collection of ideas to
continue on:

* **Set up remote access for your NextBox** to allow access to your
  private cloud from the internet. Our :doc:`guide <remote/index>` covers
  various approaches.

.. hint:: We prepared a *one-click* remote access method, allowing you
   to set up basic remote access in seconds. 
   


* **Connect your devices to your NextBox.** For smartphones the offical
  `Android App`_ and `iOS App`_ are both great additions for your personal
  cloud. Apart from these there are also `Windows, macOS, Linux clients`_
  available, which integrate seamlessly into the OS of your choice. For Android
  smartphones you might want to read our pictured :doc:`guide <clients/android>`.

* **Browse the vast amount of apps** for your Nextcloud at the `official
  store`_ for Nextcloud apps. Alternatively, just browse, find and install
  directly from within your NextBox via the built-in app manager and browser.

* **Extend your Dashboard** using the various `Dashboard Integrations`_ to
  create your personal information hub.

* **Share photos, documents, any files, bookmarks and much more with your
  family and friends**, or become part of a `Federation`_ and share,
  communicate and collaborate with other Nextcloud users.

* **Your communications under your control** - use Nextcloud's powerful
  `groupware apps`_ like *Mail*, *Contacts*, *Calendar* or even *Deck* to have
  all your personal data under your control or to organize and work together
  with others.
